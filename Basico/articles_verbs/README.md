## Weather conditions

## Lectura: El clima de Bogotá - Bogotá’s weather

I live in Colombia. Many people think Colombia is always hot, but it’s not like that. I live in the capital, Bogotá. It is located at an average altitude of 2,640 meters above sea level. Because of that, it’s normally very cold here, especially at night. For me, it’s a great city to live in, since I LOVE cold weather. It’s warm sometimes, but usually, it’s cloudy and rainy. There are other cities in Colombia where it’s sunny and hot, like Cartagena. Or warm and windy, like San Andrés. It’s great living here because you can find all kinds of weather.

## What Time Is It?

Existen dos maneras para responder una pregunta acerca del tiempo "***What time is it?\*** ":

### Usar números para decir la hora

- Primero la hora y luego los minutos.
- Para la hora exacta se utiliza la palabra “**o’clock**”.
- Para los minutos precedidos por un cero (01 al 09) se utiliza la palabra “**O**” (oh) entre la hora y los minutos.

### Ejemplos de cómo decir la hora

| **Time** | **Sentence**            |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| 01:00    | It’s one o’clock.       |
| 04:05    | It’s four o five.       |
| 06:15    | It’s six fifteen.       |

### Usar “past” y “to” para hablar sobre la hora

**Desde el primer minuto hasta la mitad de la hora se usará “\*past\*” o “\*after\*”**. Para formular la oración se pondrán primero los minutos transcurridos y después la hora: **It’s + (minutos) + past/after + (hora).**

- It’s five past ten (10:05)

**Desde la mitad de la hora hasta el último minuto se usará “\*to\*”**. Para formular la oración se pondrán primeros los minutos que faltan para la siguiente hora y después la siguiente hora: **It’s + (minutos que faltan) + to + (siguiente hora).**

- It’s a quarter to ten (9:45)

Otras consideraciones son:

- Para la **hora exacta** se utiliza la palabra “***o’clock\***”.
- Para **un cuarto de hora** se utiliza la palabra “***a quarter\***”.
- Para **la media hora** se utiliza la palabra “***half\***”.

### Ejemplos usando *o’clock*, *past/after* y *to*
